Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset

The project aimed to revolutionize fashion recommendations by overcoming challenges related to dataset imbalance and feature extraction. With a focus on user experience in online fashion retail, the team envisioned a robust CNN-based model capable of handling 142 distinct fashion categories.

The CNN architecture, characterized by multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers, is meticulously designed for optimized feature extraction and classification accuracy. Beyond categorization, the system excels in extracting intricate features from fashion images, offering potential applications such as similarity matching in recommendations. Positioned at the intersection of deep learning and real-world e-commerce solutions, this project delves into practical challenges in machine learning, contributing to an enhanced user experience in the realm of online fashion retail.
